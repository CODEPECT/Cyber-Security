## Introduction
Cyber security is a critical field that focuses on protecting computer systems, networks, and data from cyber threats. This guide covers various aspects of cyber security, from fundamental concepts to advanced practices.

## Fundamentals

### What is Cyber Security?
- **Definition**: The practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks.
- **Importance**: Ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

### Types of Cyber Threats
- **Malware**: Malicious software designed to harm or exploit systems (e.g., viruses, ransomware).
- **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attacks that aim to make a system or network unavailable to users.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Attacks where an attacker intercepts and alters communication between two parties.

### Key Concepts
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it.
- **Integrity**: Protecting information from being altered or tampered with.
- **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed.
- **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to information security.

## Advanced Topics

### Network Security
- **Definition**: Protecting the integrity and usability of network and data.
- **Key Techniques**: Firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS).

### Cryptography
- **Definition**: The practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format.
- **Key Techniques**: Encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and public key infrastructure (PKI).

### Endpoint Security
- **Definition**: Protecting devices that connect to the network from cyber threats.
- **Key Techniques**: Antivirus software, endpoint detection and response (EDR), and device management.

### Incident Response
- **Definition**: The process of detecting, responding to, and recovering from cyber security incidents.
- **Phases**: Preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.

### Cyber Threat Intelligence
- **Definition**: Gathering and analyzing information about current and potential cyber threats.
- **Sources**: Open source intelligence (OSINT), technical intelligence (TECHINT), and human intelligence (HUMINT).

## Tools and Technologies

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- **Function**: Collecting, analyzing, and reporting on security events from multiple sources.
- **Examples**: Splunk, IBM QRadar, and ArcSight.

### Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- **Firewalls**: Prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network.
- **IDS**: Monitor and detect potential security breaches.
- **Examples**: Palo Alto Networks, Cisco ASA, and Snort.

### Penetration Testing Tools
- **Purpose**: Simulating cyber attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Examples**: Metasploit, Nmap, and Burp Suite.

### Monitoring and Anomaly Detection
- **Purpose**: Continuously monitoring systems for unusual activity.
- **Examples**: Nagios, Zabbix, and Splunk.

## Best Practices
- **Regular Updates**: Keeping software and systems up-to-date.
- **Access Controls**: Implementing strong access control measures.
- **User Awareness**: Educating users about security best practices.
- **Incident Reporting**: Establishing clear procedures for reporting security incidents.
